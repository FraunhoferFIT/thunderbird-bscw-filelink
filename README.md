# Thunderbird Filelink add-on for BSCW

This is a Thunderbird v68+ MailExtension which uploads file attachments to a BSCW server 
automatically when attaching large files to your emails.

Inspiration was taken from projects such as:

* https://github.com/thosmos/filelink-owncloud
* https://gitlab.com/joendres/filelink-nextcloud
* https://github.com/darktrojan/dav
* https://github.com/thundernest/sample-extensions/tree/master/dropbox

## Installation
Just create a zip archive of the whole repository and rename the .zip file to .xpi.

This add-on will also be made available on https://addons.thunderbird.net once it is ready.
